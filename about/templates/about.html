              <p>Every year, more and more plastic ends up in the worldâ€™s oceans, which has had a devastating impact on marine life. There is often little or no incentive to reduce plastic use and remove the plastic before it enters the ocean.</p>
              <p>Message In A Bottle aims to create awareness about the effects of plastic pollution in the ocean including ways to help with the current pollution, prevention and promotion of charities for donations and our game 'Something Fishy'.</p>
              <p>We invite users to sign up and get involved from around the world to create, view and share blog posts and events to help fight plastic pollution.<p><br>
